<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This vignette is part of the NIA funded Longevity Genomics project. For more information on this project please visit its website <a href="http://www.longevitygenomics.org/projects/">here</a>. The GitHub repository of the corresponding R package is available <a href="https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools">here</a> and the most recent version of this vignette can be found <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools_eDRUG.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The project component covered by this vignette analyzes drug- and age-related genome-wide expression data from public microarray and RNA-Seq experiments. One of the main objective is the identification drug candidates modulating the expression of longevity genes and pathways. For this, we compare age-related expression signatures with those from drug treamtments. The age-related query signatures are from recent publications such as Peters et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span> and Sood et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span>, while the drug-related reference signatures are from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) and LINCS projects <span class="citation">(Lamb et al. 2006)</span>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Installation</h2>
<p>The R software for running <a href="https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools"><em><code>longevityTools</code></em></a> can be downloaded from <a href="http://cran.at.r-project.org/"><em>CRAN</em></a>. The <em><code>longevityTools</code></em> package can be installed from the R console using the following <em><code>biocLite</code></em> install command.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>source(&quot;http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;) # Sources the biocLite.R installation script

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Download data from Connectivity Map project site</h2>
<p>The drug-related expression data are downloaded from the CMAP web site <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap">here</a>. The <code>getCmap</code> function downloads the CMAP rank matrix along with the compound annotations, and <code>getCmapCEL</code> downloads the corresponding 7,056 CEL files. The functions will write the downloaded files to the <code>data</code> and <code>data/CEL</code> directories within the present working directory of the user’s R session. Since some of the raw data sets are large, the functions will only rerun the download if the argument <code>rerun</code> is assigned <code>TRUE</code>. If the raw data are not needed then users can skip this time consuming download step and work with the preprocessed data obtained in the next section.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>getCmap(rerun=FALSE) # Downloads cmap rank matrix and compound annotation files
getCmapCEL(rerun=FALSE) # Download cmap CEL files. Note, this will take some time</code></pre>

<p>The experimental design of the CMAP project is defined in the file <code>cmap_instances_02.xls</code>. Note, this file required some cleaning in LibreOffice (Excel would work for this too). After this it was saved as tab delimited txt file named <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/cmap_instances_02.txt">cmap_instances_02.txt</a>.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Determine chip type from CEL files</h2>
<p>The CMAP data set is based on three different Affymetrix chip types (HG-U133A, HT_HG-U133A and U133AAofAv2). The following extracts the chip type information from the CEL files and stores the result in an <code>rds</code> file with the path <code>./data/chiptype.rds</code>. Users who skipped the download of the CEL files can download this file <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/chiptype.rds">here</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Normalization of CEL files</h2>
<p>The follwoing processes the CEL files from each chip type separately using the MAS5 normalization algorithm. The results will be written to 3 subdirectores under <code>data</code> that are named after the chip type names. To save time, the processing is parallelized with <code>BiocParallel</code> to run on 100 CPU cores of a computer cluster with a scheduler (<em>e.g.</em> Torque). The number of CEL files from each chip type are: 807 CEL files from HG-U133A, 6029 CEL files from HT_HG-U133A, and 220 CEL files from U133AAofAv2. Note, these numbers are slightly different than those reported in the <code>cmap_instances_02.txt</code> file. The MAS5 normalized data sets can be downloaded here: <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/HG-U133A/all_mas5exprs.rds">HG-U133A</a>, <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/HT_HG-U133A/all_mas5exprs.rds">HT_HG-U133A</a>, <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/data/U133AAofAv2/all_mas5exprs.rds">U133AAofAv2</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Obtain annotation information</h2>
<p>The following generates annotation information for the Affymetirx probe set identifiers. Note, the three different Affymetrix chip types used by CMAP share most probe set ids (&gt;95%), meaning it is possible to combine the data after normalization and use the same annotation package for all of them. The annotation libraries for the chip types HG-U133A and HT_HG-U133A are <code>hgu133a.db</code> and <code>hthgu133a.db</code>, respectively. However, there is no annotation library (e.g. CDF) available for U133AAofAv2. The annotation file can be downloaded from here: <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/results/myAnnot.xls"><code>myAnnot.xls</code></a>.</p>

## Transform probe set to gene level data

The `probeset2gene` function translates a binary DEG matrix from the probe level (`row.names` are
Affy IDs) to the gene level (`row.names` are gene IDs). Genes represented by several probe
sets (rows) will be collapsed based on a chosen summary rule. The following summary rules are
supported: `summary_rule=1L` will consider a gene as a DEG for a specific treatment if at 
least one of several probe sets supports this assignment, while `summary_rule=2L` requires 
support from at least 2 probe sets.


```r
myAnnot <- readRDS("./results/myAnnot.rds") 
degMA <- readRDS("./results/degMA.rds") # Faster than read.delim()
degMAgene <- probeset2gene(degMA, myAnnot, geneIDtype="ENTREZID", summary_rule=1L)
saveRDS(degMAgene, "./results/degMAgene.rds")

<p>Peters et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span> reported 1,497 age-related gene expression signatures. The <code>intersectStats</code> function computes their intersects with each of the 3,318 drug-responsive DEG sets from CMAP. The result includes the Jaccard index as a simple similarity metric for gene sets as well as the raw and adjusted p-values based on the hypergeometric distribution expressing how likely it is to obtain the observed intersect sizes just by chance. The results for the 20 top scoring drugs are given below and the full data set is written to a file named <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/results/degOL_PMID26490707.xls"><code>degOL_PMID26490707.xls</code></a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.7</span> Identify DEG overlaps with Sood et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span></h2>
<p>Sood et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span> reported 150 age-related gene expression signatures. The <code>intersectStats</code> function computes their intersects with each of the 3,318 drug-responsive DEG sets from CMAP. The result includes the Jaccard index as a simple similarity metric for gene sets as well as the raw and adjusted p-values based on the hypergeometric distribution expressing how likely it is to observe the observed intersect sizes just by chance. The results for the 20 top scoring drugs are given below and the full data set is written to a file named <a href="http://biocluster.ucr.edu/~tgirke/projects/longevity/cmap/results/degOL_PMID26343147.xls"><code>degOL_PMID26343147.xls</code></a>.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Connectivity maps enrichment analysis</h1>
<p>The connectivity maps approach is a rank-based enrichment method utilizing the KS test <span class="citation">(Lamb et al. 2006)</span>. It measures the similarities of expression signatures based on the enrichment of up- and down-regulated genes at the top and bottom of sorted (ranked) gene lists.</p>
<div id="query-drug-signatures" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Query drug signatures</h2>
<p>The following uses the 1,497 age-related gene expression signatures from Peters et al. <span class="citation">(2015)</span> as a query against the CMAP signatures. The results are sorted by the ES Distance and the top scoring 20 drugs are given below.
